Description: This paper describes simple and flexible programs for conducting lag 
        sequential event analyses using SAS and SPSS. The programs read a stream of codes 
        and produce a variety of lag sequential statistics, including transitional frequencies, 
        expected transitional frequencies, transitional probabilities, z values, adjusted 
        residuals, Yule's Q values, likelihood ratio tests of stationarity across time 
        and homogeneity across groups or segments, transformed kappas for unidirectional 
        dependence, bidirectional dependence, parallel and nonparallel dominance, and 
        significance levels based on both parametric and randomization tests.
