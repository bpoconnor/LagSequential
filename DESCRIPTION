Description: This package provides functions for conducting lag sequential analyses. 
        The programs read a stream of codes, or a frequency transition matrix, and 
        produce a variety of lag sequential statistics, including transitional 
        frequencies, expected transitional frequencies, transitional probabilities, 
        z values, adjusted residuals, Yule's Q values, likelihood ratio tests of 
        stationarity across time and homogeneity across groups or segments, transformed 
        kappas for unidirectional dependence, bidirectional dependence, parallel 
        and nonparallel dominance, and significance levels based on both parametric 
        and randomization tests.
